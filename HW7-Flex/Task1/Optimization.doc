4. Using sass extends (for not duplicating code)

8. Using separate scss-files for every "module"
9. Using flexbox
10. Using understandable class-names with BEM (so there is no need to write comments)
11. Not using !important
12. Using sass-nestings (blocks of css code became more readable)
13. The structure of scss code dublicates structure of html
14. Using "reset" file - for setting main css-rules for page
15. Not using inline styles
16. Grouping padding-top, padding-left, padding-right into "padding" (also margin)
